This is the 2022-2023 season's code for  team 7797 Victorian Voltage.

Credits: All code within this repository is from either the 2024-2025 FTC Roadrunner Quickstart, EasyOpenCV library or is the work of Indrajith
Thyagaraja, Sam Xu with help from Laura Szabo from team #7797 Victorian Voltage. 

Guide/Breakdown: All important code files are found under TeamCode/src/main/java. Here there are 5 folders:

    -Autonomous: Each folder describes the type of autonomous the files inside are. These are based on the robot's starting position on the field. 
    There are a lot of different versions for each.
    
    -TeleOp: There are a lot of different versions, but the one that is the most finalized is the AntiTipTeleOp file. 
    
    -pipelines: These are the files for the camera detection. The AprilTagDetectionPipeline is a premade pipeline form EasyOpenCV, we did not write it. 
    This pipeline is used in the majority of the Autonomous files. 
    
    -org/firstinspires/ftc/teamcode: These contain some of the files from the Roadrunner Quickstart. These are unmodified. 
    
    -Trash - These are old files that we didn't want to delete. They can be ignored.
